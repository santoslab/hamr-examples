--       SimpleTemp - illustrate a temperature data type with only degrees (not unit) as a field
--       Mixed - with mixed port catagories (event, data, event data)
--       UI - with a simple UI for an operator interface   
--
--       Platform - Slang/JVM -- this example is designed for the HAMR Slang/JVM platform.  
--         Other versions of this example illustrate Linux and seL4 platforms.
--
--       The package structure reflects a conceptual business ecosystem in which stakeholders exchange AADL
--       modeling elements to manage distributed development:
--         - temperature sensor and cooling fan components are acquired from suppliers other than the 
--            system integrator (thus, these components are located in separate packages delivered by those suppliers).
--         - the system integrator designs the temperature controller and operator interface for the system
--            (thus, those components are in this package) and integrates all components into a system.

      -- For simplicity in this introductory example, a single process is used.
      -- On the Slang/JVM platform, process architecture does not affect code generation.
      -- However, for Linux and seL4 platforms, there are constraints on the structure 
      -- of processes and their contents because processes reflect separate memory address
      -- spaces, which are reflected in code generation, e.g., as distinct seL4 partitions (CAmkES components).
      -- The broader concept here is that the notion of AADL process is used by HAMR to 
      -- model partitioning/isolation of software elements.
      --
      -- In a more realistic model of this system, the integrator might want to partition the
      -- control logic (tempControl Thread) which is higher criticality and operator interface 
      -- which is lower criticality (and partitioning of the operator interface might help contain
      -- security attacks (intrusions).   Drivers for hardware elements (temp sensor and fan) might also
      -- be isolated from other components.

        --   
        --       At the Slang level, each handler's contract is formed by conjoining the compute entry point 
        --       general clauses with the contract clauses given in the handlers.
        --       For the modifies clauses, CURRENTLY, the modifies clauses must be identical to the modifies
        --       clause in the compute entry point general clauses.  Note this means that the modifies may be
        --       an over-approximation -- some listed variables may actually not be modified in the handler.
        --       (I believe SPARK would give an error/warning if a listed variable is not written on at least
        --        one path, but Logika does not enforce that).    
        --       Thus, in the current state of the tools, if a variable is not actually modified
